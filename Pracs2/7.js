// Create a button element with a value attribute set to “CLICK ME and WAIT” 
// and invoke a click event on the button, which calls a function that changes 
// the button’s text value color to red. At the same time, this function also sets up a timed 
// function using setTimeout() that sets the text color back to black after 5 seconds.
